Assignment 1

Render a rectangle as a pair of triangles textured with an image of your choice in two different positions on screen.

You must use the same buffers for both, but change the position using a shader uniform in the vertex shader.

Bonus: Add a uniform to the fragment shader and change the color or texture coordinate of the final pixel based on input.
